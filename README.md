# DropX Partner Dashboard

Deployment sync: dashboard Git connection enabled on 2026-07-19.

Next.js dashboard for Provider ID mapping, rate cards, report imports, earnings, exceptions, and salary controls.

## Current Status

This frontend is scaffolded with mock data and is ready to connect to the Supabase schema that has already been applied to the `DropX Partner` project.

## Local Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://uimajyffojydenqsegjv.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://dashboard.dropxlogistics.com
CASH_RECON_WORKER_URL=https://cash-recon-worker.withered-voice-1c40.workers.dev
CASH_RECON_ADMIN_KEY=
REPORT_AUTO_WORKER_URL=https://report-auto-worker.withered-voice-1c40.workers.dev
REPORT_AUTO_ADMIN_KEY=
# Set to false to hide the Auto upload button until the worker is deployed
# REPORT_AUTO_UI_ENABLED=true
```

Never expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to browser or mobile code.

## Report Auto upload

On **Report Imports**, each worker-backed source has **Upload file** (manual) and **Auto upload**.

Auto calls `POST /api/report-imports/auto-run`, which proxies `REPORT_AUTO_WORKER_URL` with `x-admin-key`. Sources: `amazon_shipments`, `daily_edsp_metrics`, `delivered_shipment_detail`, `iocl_fuel`, `bpcl_fuel`, `cashbook`.

Workforce Auto first checks `formattedCreationDate` on Amazon’s weekly-supp catalog. If Amazon has not published today’s files (often 8am–12pm IST), the API returns 409 — use Manual upload.

Morning automation lives on the worker (06:00 IST kickoff + 08:00–15:00 IST poll). Set `REPORT_UPLOAD_ENABLED=true` and `DASHBOARD_IMPORT_COOKIE` on the worker so files land in Import Master. Hide the button with `REPORT_AUTO_UI_ENABLED=false` until that worker is deployed.

OpsPulse Network Planning setup and operating notes are in `docs/ops-network-planning.md`.

For independently assignable Ops menu permissions, run `scripts/ops_menu_permissions_v1.sql` before deploying the matching application release. The migration preserves current Performance, Capacity, Reports, Performance Master, and Capacity Master grants while separating their future access controls.

## Invitation Email Sender

User invitations are sent by Supabase Auth when `Send email invitation` is checked while creating a user. To send from `notification@dropxlogistics.com`, configure custom SMTP in Supabase Auth with:

- Sender email: `notification@dropxlogistics.com`
- Sender name: `DropX`
- SMTP host, port, username, and password from the DropX email provider
- Verified DNS records for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC

Keep the Supabase redirect allowlist including `https://dashboard.dropxlogistics.com/login` and `https://dashboard.dropxlogistics.com/auth/callback`.

## Vercel Setup

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repository.
2. Import the repository in Vercel.
